# whoami - MCP Personal Context Server

## Project Overview
This is a Python-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides personal context information to AI agents. The server allows agents to understand who they're talking to by providing relevant personal information about the user.

## Development Setup
This project uses Poetry for dependency management. The main dependency is FastMCP which handles the MCP protocol implementation.

## Purpose
The server acts as a bridge between AI agents and personal context, enabling more personalized and contextually aware interactions by providing information about the user's identity, preferences, and relevant background.
